## below parameters are self-explanatory
model_name: "typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli"
model_type: "discriminative" ## you can only have following types: "encode-decode","decoder-only","bart","discriminative","shared","hybrid","t5",
huggingface_class: null
decoder_model_name: null
model_path: null ## provide the path if you have custom trained model using transformers library
tie_embeddings: false
label: null
tie_encoder_decoder: false
pipeline: null

additional_model_inputs: null ## specify the additional pre-defined input to model like bean_search for generative models

tokenizer:
  model_name: ${..model_name} ## only specify the name from huggingface if it's different than the actual  model
  label2id: ## this will vary based on the evaluation data, please refer to the your selected dataset config
    contradiction: 2
    neutral: 1
    entailment: 0
  args:
    truncation: true
    padding: "max_length"

## use following dataset pre-processing steps
data_processing:
  header: null ## prompt header for input data?
  footer: null ## prompt header for signling output?
  separator: " [SEP] " ## what is separator token? leave `null` for generative models
  columns:
    null
    ## you should define this only for generative or for prompt eng. models as shown below
    # premise: null
    # hypothesis: null
